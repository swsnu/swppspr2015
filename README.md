# Discussion board for SNU SWPP `15 spr. class!
Instead of creating a separate message board, we will use this discussion repository to share our thoughts on various topics and issues that are not project-specific. You may open an issue for almost anything, using the Issues icon on the right. We recommend posting your questions and curiosities here instead of sending a personal mail to the staff mailing list. **Of course, keep your manners and do not create spam messages!**
